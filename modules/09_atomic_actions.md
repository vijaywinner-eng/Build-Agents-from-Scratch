# Atomic Steps & Safe Execution

## What Question Are We Answering?

**"How do I make plans safe and predictable?"**

Plan steps like "Write article" are vague and hard to validate. Atomic actions break steps into the smallest possible, well-defined operations that can be validated and executed safely.

## What You Will Build

An atomic action system that:
- Converts vague plan steps into specific, typed actions
- Validates actions before execution
- Uses schemas to ensure correct parameters
- Makes execution predictable and debuggable

## New Concepts Introduced

### 1. Atomicity

**Atomicity** means breaking actions into the smallest possible units. Instead of "Write article," you get "generate_text" with specific parameters like topic and length.

Atomic actions are indivisible - they either succeed completely or fail completely, with no partial states.

### 2. Determinism

**Determinism** means predictable outcomes. Given the same atomic action with the same inputs, you should get similar results (accounting for LLM randomness).

Atomic actions make execution deterministic by removing ambiguity.

### 3. Typed Execution

**Typed execution** means actions have validated schemas. Each action specifies:
- Action name (e.g., "generate_text")
- Required inputs (e.g., {"topic": string, "length": string})
- Validation rules

This catches errors before execution.

## What We Are NOT Doing (Yet)

- No dependency handling between actions ((10_atom_of_thought.md))
- No parallel execution
- No action execution implementation - just conversion and validation

## The Code

Look at `agent/planner.py`, see `create_atomic_action()` function:

```python
def create_atomic_action(llm: LocalLLM, step: str) -> dict | None:
    """
    Convert a plan step into an atomic action.
    
    Used in: 09
    
    Args:
        llm: The language model to use
        step: A step from a plan
        
    Returns:
        Atomic action as a dictionary, or None if generation failed
    """
    from shared.utils import extract_json_from_text
    
    prompt = f"""Convert this step into an atomic action. Respond with ONLY valid JSON.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Respond with ONLY valid JSON
2. No explanations, no markdown, no other text
3. Start your response with {{ and end with }}

Required JSON format:
{{
  "action": "action_name",
  "inputs": {{"key": "value"}}
}}

The action should be a simple, atomic operation name.
The inputs should be a dictionary with the parameters needed for this action.

Step to convert:
{step}

Response (JSON only):"""
    
    for attempt in range(3):
        response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.0)
        action = extract_json_from_text(response)
        
        if action and "action" in action:
            return action
    
    return None
```

And in `agent/agent.py`:

```python
def create_atomic_action(self, step: str) -> dict | None:
    """
    Convert a plan step into an atomic action.
    
    09 version.
    
    Args:
        step: A step from a plan (e.g., "Write an explanation of AI agents")
        
    Returns:
        Atomic action dictionary with "action" and "inputs", or None if generation failed
    """
    return create_atomic_action(self.llm, step)
```

Notice:
- **Step conversion** - Vague steps become specific actions with parameters
- **Schema validation** - Actions must have "action" and "inputs" fields
- **Structured output** - Uses the same JSON pattern from previous 
- **Retry logic** - Multiple attempts to get valid atomic actions

## How to Run

Look at `complete_example.py`, see `09_atomic_actions()` method:

```python
from agent.agent import Agent

agent = Agent("models/llama-3-8b-instruct.gguf")

# Convert a plan step into an atomic action
step = "Write an explanation of AI agents"
atomic_action = agent.create_atomic_action(step)
print(f"Step: {step}")
print(f"Atomic action: {atomic_action}")

# Example with a step from a plan
plan = agent.create_plan("Create a tutorial about Python")
if plan and "steps" in plan and plan["steps"]:
    first_step = plan["steps"][0]
    atomic_action_from_plan = agent.create_atomic_action(first_step)
    print(f"\nPlan step: {first_step}")
    print(f"Atomic action from plan step: {atomic_action_from_plan}")
```

## Compare to 08

** 08 (Planning):**
```
Goal -> Plan: ["Research topic", "Create outline", "Write draft"]
```
Plans are lists of vague step descriptions.

** 09 (Atomic Actions):**
```
Step: "Write draft" -> Atomic: {"action": "generate_text", "inputs": {"topic": "...", "length": "..."}}
```
Steps become specific, typed actions with validated parameters.

## Key Insights

### Small Steps = Safe Systems

The smaller the action, the safer the system. Atomic actions are:
- Easier to validate - you can check parameters before execution
- Easier to test - each action can be tested independently
- Easier to debug - failures are isolated to specific actions
- Harder to fail catastrophically - small actions have limited blast radius

### Vague vs Specific

"Write article" is vague. "generate_text(topic='AI agents', length='1000 words')" is specific. Specificity enables validation and predictable execution.

### Validation Happens Early

By validating actions before execution, you catch errors early. A plan with invalid actions can be rejected before any work is done.

### Building Blocks

Atomic actions are building blocks. Complex workflows are built from many simple atomic actions, each validated and safe.

## Common Issues

**"Atomic action is still vague"**
- Provide clearer instructions in the prompt
- Give examples of good atomic actions
- Consider constraining the action names to a predefined set

**"Validation fails"**
- Check that the action has both "action" and "inputs" fields
- Verify the JSON structure is correct
- Consider adding schema validation for inputs

**"Conversion fails"**
- Some steps might not map cleanly to atomic actions
- Consider multiple retry attempts (already implemented)
- Provide more context about what makes a good atomic action
