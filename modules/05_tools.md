# Introducing Tools 

## What Question Are We Answering?

**"Can the model ask me to do something?"**

Tools extend the agent's capabilities beyond text generation. Instead of only generating text, the agent can request actions like calculations, API calls, or file operations.

## What You Will Build

A tool-calling system that:
- Lets the agent request specific tools with structured parameters
- Validates tool requests before execution
- Separates tool requests from tool execution
- Extends agent capabilities without retraining the model

## New Concepts Introduced

### 1. Tool Interfaces

A **tool interface** is a defined API the agent can request. Tools have names and parameters, like `calculator(a, b, operation)`. The agent requests the tool, but the system executes it.

This separation is critical - the agent **describes** what it needs, but you **control** what actually happens.

### 2. Structured Tool Calls

Tool calls are **structured JSON specifications** for function calls. The model outputs JSON like `{"tool": "calculator", "arguments": {"a": 42, "b": 7, "operation": "multiply"}}`, and your code validates and executes it.

This is similar to decision making, but instead of choosing an action, the agent is specifying a function call.

### 3. Model-Chosen Actions

The agent decides **which tool to use** and **what parameters to pass**. You define available tools, but the agent chooses which one fits the situation.

This is agency at work - the agent is selecting and configuring actions.

## Important Rule

The model **requests** tools. The system **executes** them. No autonomy yet. This separation gives you control and safety.

## What We Are NOT Doing (Yet)

- No agent loop ((06_agent_loop.md))
- No memory ((07_memory.md))
- No automatic tool execution - you still manually execute tool calls

## The Code

Look at `agent/agent.py`, see `request_tool()` method:

```python
def request_tool(self, user_input: str) -> dict | None:
    """
    Have the model request a tool call.
    
    version.
    
    Args:
        user_input: The user's request
        
    Returns:
        Tool call specification or None if request failed
    """
    prompt = f"""{self.system_prompt}

You are a tool-calling assistant. When asked a math question, you must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Available tool: calculator
- Parameters: a (number), b (number), operation ("add", "subtract", "multiply", or "divide")

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Respond with ONLY valid JSON
2. No explanations, no markdown, no other text
3. Start your response with {{ and end with }}

Example format:
{{"tool": "calculator", "arguments": {{"a": 42, "b": 7, "operation": "multiply"}}}}

User request: {user_input}

Response (JSON only):"""
    
    for attempt in range(3):
        response = self.llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.0)
        parsed = extract_json_from_text(response)
        
        if parsed and "tool" in parsed and "arguments" in parsed:
            return parsed
    
    return None

def execute_tool_call(self, tool_call: dict) -> Any:
    """
    Execute a tool call requested by the model.
    
    Args:
        tool_call: Dictionary with "tool" and "arguments"
        
    Returns:
        Result of the tool execution
    """
    return execute_tool(tool_call["tool"], tool_call["arguments"])
```

Notice:
- **Structured output** - The tool call is validated JSON, similar to 
- **Validation** - We check that both "tool" and "arguments" are present
- **Separation of concerns** - Request and execution are separate methods
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new tools without changing the model

## How to Run

Look at `complete_example.py`, see `lesson_05_tools()` method:

```python
from agent.agent import Agent

agent = Agent("models/llama-3-8b-instruct.gguf")

tool_call = agent.request_tool("What is 42 * 7?")
print(f"Tool request: {tool_call}")

if tool_call:
    result = agent.execute_tool_call(tool_call)
    print(f"Tool result: {result}")
```

## Compare

** (Decision Making):**
```
Input: "What should I do?"
Choices: ["answer", "calculate", "translate"]
Output: "calculate"
```
The agent picks from a list of actions.

** (Tool Calling):**
```
Input: "What is 42 * 7?"
Tool: calculator
Arguments: {"a": 42, "b": 7, "operation": "multiply"}
Result: 294
```
The agent specifies a tool call with parameters and gets a result.

## Key Insights

### Tools Are Interfaces, Not Abilities

The agent doesn't have the ability - you do. The agent describes what it needs through a structured interface, and you provide the implementation. This keeps you in control.

### No Retraining Required

To add new capabilities, you add new tools. The model doesn't need retraining - it just needs to understand the tool interface. This is powerful.

### Safety Through Separation

By separating tool requests from execution, you can validate, log, and control what actually happens. The agent can't execute dangerous operations without your code allowing it.

### Structured = Reliable

Using the same structured JSON pattern from Lessons 03 and 04 makes tool calls reliable and parseable. The model outputs structured data, you validate it, then execute.

## Common Issues

**"The model requests a tool that doesn't exist"**
- Validate the tool name against your available tools
- Provide clear examples of available tools in the prompt
- Handle invalid tool names gracefully

**"The arguments are the wrong type"**
- Validate argument types before execution
- Make the expected types clear in the tool description
- Consider using schema validation for complex tools

**"The model doesn't request a tool when it should"**
- Make it clear when tools should be used
- Provide examples in the prompt
- Consider making tool use mandatory for certain request types


## What's Next?

In (06_agent_loop.md), we'll create the **agent loop** - putting decision making and tool calling together into a repeating cycle.
